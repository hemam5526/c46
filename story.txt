Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a Monkey who resided on a jamoon tree.

There also lived a Crocodile and his wife by the banks of the river

One day the Crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.

The Monkey offered him some fruits.

And thats how they became friends.
